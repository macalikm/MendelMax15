Before Reporting a Bug
Test with the bugfix-2.0.x branch to see whether the issue still exists.

Get troubleshooting help from the Marlin community to confirm it's a bug and not just a configuration error. Links at https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/new/choose

Instructions
Fill out every section of the template below.

Always attach configuration files, regardless of whether you think they are involved.

Bug Description
x and y vibrate and move erratically when moving to the z safe homing point

Configuration Files
Required: Include a ZIP file containing Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h.

If you've made any other modifications describe them in detail here.

Steps to Reproduce
Initiate "Home All" from BT TFT 24
Expected behavior:

X Homes to the Mech Endstop in the min. position
Y Homes to the Mech Endstop in the min. position
Z moves diagonally to the Z_SAFE_HOMING_POINT (roughly the center of the bed)
BLTouch deploys
Z homes to the build plate until BLTouch triggers
Actual behavior:
X Homes to the Mech Endstop in the min. position
Y Homes to the Mech Endstop in the min. position
--> X and Y vibrate and move erratically towards the Z_SAFE_HOMING_POINT but never makes it.
--> The Main Screen on the LCD Displays the proper X and Y position
BLTouch deploys
Z homes to the build plate until BLTouch triggers

Additional Information
Lowering XY _HOMING_FEEDRATE and HOME_BUMP_DIVISOR help.
If I physically push the X and Y carriages they will move to the Z_SAFE_HOMING_POINT

Bug Description
When homing with G28 Marlin (at least in Bugfix-2.0.x, I didn't check any other versions) is using the wrong speed to move to the safe homing position. Currently the code is using XY_PROBE_SPEED, which is the speed to use when moving between points while doing ABL, which may or may not be configured by the user. This speed is often set quite high (the default is certainly quite high on my system), which tends to cause quite a lot of noise at the beginning of every print.
This should probably be HOMING_FEEDRATE_XY, as this is part of every G28, not ABL at all.

My Configurations
configuration.zip

Steps to Reproduce
G28 (with safe homing enabled)
Expected behavior: homes using the homing feedrate

Actual behavior: homes using the ABL probing feedrate

Additional Information
The code in Marlin/src/gcode/calibrate/G28.cpp uses do_blocking_move_to for both quick_home_xy() and home_z_safely(), while it should probably be using do_homing_move()
The other possibility is that do_blocking_move_to() should use homing_feedrate() for xy, it already uses it for z, but it seems unlikely (although the fact that it uses it for Z might be a bug)

When not defined HOMING_FEEDRATE_XY is assigned to it automatically. It is the preferred setting to use because it is intended to differentiate the speed that could harm the probe from the speed of approach to endstops.
